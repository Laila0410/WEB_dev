        <p>Stand in awe before the legendary <strong>Mount Everest</strong>, the highest mountain on Earth and the ultimate symbol of human ambition.<br>

Rising 8,848 meters above sea level, Everest towers over the Himalayas on the border between <strong>Nepal and Tibet</strong>. Its snow-covered peaks and dramatic ridges define nature at its most powerful and majestic.<br>

The mountain is known as <em>Sagarmatha</em> in Nepal and <em>Chomolungma</em> in Tibet, both names honoring it as a sacred mother of the world. The extreme altitude, freezing temperatures, and thin air make Everest one of the most challenging places on the planet.<br>

From breathtaking viewpoints in the Khumbu region to the iconic <em>Everest Base Camp</em>, visitors are rewarded with unforgettable views of glaciers, icefalls, and towering Himalayan peaks. Every angle offers a reminder of the raw beauty and scale of the world’s highest mountain.<br></p>

        <h2>The poem about Everest</h2>
        <p>In icy embraces, where the sky barely breathes,<br>
She stands—the goddess, mother of the peaks.<br>
Where winds and blizzards reign,<br>
She crowns the mountain giant.<br>
Sagarmatha, the summit of all aspirations,<br>
Opens the clouds only to the brave.<br>
And millions of mental obeisances<br>
To her will ascend the mountaineer of the century.<br></p>
