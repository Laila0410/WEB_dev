         <br><h1>Poem</h1><br><h1>poem: Summer <em>author</em>: Abay Kunanbayev</h1>
        <p>When summer in the mountains gains its peak,<br>
When gaily blooming flowers begin to fade,<br>
When nomads from the sunshine refuge seek,<br>
And in the canyons find a cooling shade,<br>
When horses roam the valleys and the hills,<br>
And all the world is filled with joy and light—<br>
Then, when the very air with music thrills,<br>
My heart is filled with wonder and delight. </p>
